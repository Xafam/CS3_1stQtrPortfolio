# **List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with three to five sentences.**
## 1. Variable Declaration
### Variable Declaration is about the keywords we can use for declaring variables. Some keywords we can use are "var", "let", etc. These keywords help us store value into our code.
## 2. JavaScript Operations
### Java Script Operations is a lesson about the operations that we can use in Java Script. The types of operations are Arithmetic, Comparison, Logical, Assignment, and Ternary. Some examples of these operators would be "+", "-", "=", "!", "<", ">", "%", etc.
## 3. JavaScript Basic Statements
### JavaScript Basic Statements are about the different ways we can output our answer to the computer. The types of ways we can do that are "document.write()", "console.log()", "alert()", etc. Document write is for putting the output in the browser, console log is for putting the output in the console, and alert is for putting the output as an alert dialog box.
## 4. If Else Statements
### If Else Satements are about making different solutions for different conditions. Depending on the condition, a different answer will be given. Some operators we can use for this are "==", "===", "!=", "!==", etc.
## 5. Switch Statements
### Switch Satements are very similar to If Else Satements. The only difference is how you do it.  When we use switch staments, we use "Switch(condition)", "Case", Break".

# **List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.**
## 1. Custom Functions
### I think that I still need to practice this because I still do not know whether or not one can be plausible.
## 2. Function as Declaration
### I think that I still need to practice this because I usually do not use it as I do not see the relevance.
## 3. Function as an Expression
### I think that I still need to practice this because I still get confused on how to do it.
## 4. Using the Return Statement
### I think that I still need to practice this because I do not get what it does and need more clarification.
## 5. HTML Events
### I still do not understand this topic very clearly because It is very complex for my understanding.

# **Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.**
## PLAN OF ACTION
### My plan of action to help myself understand these topics further are by practicing more and watching lectures. My way of learning is by listening to lectures and practicing by coding. So, I feel that this would be very effective for me to do.

# **In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?**
## EFFECTIVE
### 1. Kahoot - The Kahoot sessions that we did in class were fun and effective thanks to Ma'am Aline's thourough explanations after every question.
### 2. Speed Tests - The speed tests were very effective because it helped me think and create codes faster and cleaner.
## NOT EFFECTIVE
### 1. 4th Graded Exercise - I felt that this was too easy to do as you only needed to do switch case statements.
### 2. 6th Graded Exercise - I felt that this exercise was too simple and easy.
